# Listening Test Application

This application is a web-based listening test designed to evaluate emotional responses to music. Participants listen to a series of songs and assess each one based on four emotions: **Aggressive, Relaxed, Happy,** and **Sad**. Each emotion is rated on a scale from -3 (strongly opposed) to +3 (strongly present).
